# Living Dex Tracker — Implementation TODO

Companion to the specification. Work top to bottom: Phase 0 and 1 build the machine,
Phase 2 feeds it one game at a time.

## How this file works

- **Every version is its own game entity.** Red and Blue are two entities, not one
  "Red/Blue" row. Same for Gold/Silver, Sword/Shield, Scarlet/Violet, and every other pair.
  Version exclusives are the whole reason this matters.
- **Phase 2 is the repeating part.** Each game has the same 7-step checklist. A game is
  "done" when all 7 are ticked and its validation run is green.
- **Games are independent.** Adding Emerald must not require touching Platinum's data.
  Anything shared belongs in Phase 0, not in a game's data file.
- Tick boxes as you go. Add notes inline under a step when something is unusual.
- **Finished items move out.** When an item is done, cut it from this file and paste it
  into `DONE dex tracker.md` under the matching section, ticked and dated. That file
  explains the exact shape. Partial work stays here until every sub-step is done.

## Phase 0 — Foundations (no game data yet)

### 0.1 Project setup
- [ ] Windows build target: installer or portable exe, verified to run on a clean machine
  - `publish/LivingDex.exe` is a single self-contained file, verified to run from an empty
    folder with nothing beside it. Still open: a Windows install without the WebView2
    Runtime, and a Windows 10 box.

---

## Phase 1 — First vertical slice

_Done. The slice works end to end; what it is short of is game data, which is Phase 2._

Build the whole app against two games before scaling the data out.
Target: **Platinum** as main game, **Emerald** linked.


---

## Phase 2 — Games, one at a time

### The per-game checklist

Every game below repeats these 8 steps:

1. **Entity + edges** — register the game, its metadata, and its transfer edges in both directions
2. **Dex list** — which species and forms it contains, and their numbering in this game
3. **Wild** — every encounter slot: location, sub-area, method, level range, rate, time, season, weather
4. **Gifts & statics** — starters, fossils, revives, NPC gifts, eggs, legendary statics
5. **Trades & evolutions** — in-game NPC trades, which evolution triggers are actually
   possible here, and the babies only the day care produces
6. **Sprites** — battle sprites for this generation, or the documented fallback
7. **Events** — for every entry still marked unobtainable, find out whether a distribution event
   ever handed one out, and say so in its reason
8. **Validate + smoke test** — validation green, then create a collection with this game as main game

Step 7 can only run once steps 1 to 6 are done: its input is the list of entries nothing in the
game produces, and that is not known before. It does not change what is obtainable — an event you
had to attend in 2006 is not a way to fill a dex today — it changes the answer a player gets, from
"nothing can produce this" to "nothing you can play can produce this, and here is what once did".
The place to look is the species' own *In events* section on Bulbapedia, which lists the games
each distribution was for.

Validating and smoke testing stay last, because they are the step that says the game is finished:
they should be looking at the final data, reasons included, rather than at a version of it that is
about to be edited.

Order to work in: start with Gen 3 and Gen 4 (already partly done in Phase 1),
then Gen 1–2, then forward through Gen 5 onward.

### Generation 1

_Done: all three. Red, Blue and Yellow are Kanto on the 3DS._

**Virtual Console only.** Generations 1 and 2 are in this dataset as their 3DS Virtual Console
releases and not as the cartridges. A Game Boy cartridge trades with another Game Boy cartridge
and reaches nothing else, so what is caught on one can never join a living dex kept anywhere
later; the Virtual Console releases can, through Poké Transporter into Bank, and that route is
the whole reason they are here. The same decision governs Generation 2 below.

_What Kanto shares is in `kanto.py`, what Generation 1 shares is in `gb.py`, and what every
Virtual Console release shares is in `vc.py`. Twelve edges are waiting: each of the three opens
a Time Capsule with each of Gold, Silver and Crystal, and each reaches Bank._

### Generation 2

_Gold and Silver are done and in `DONE dex tracker.md`. Crystal reads the same modules -
`vc.py`, `gbc.py` for the generation, `johto.py` for the region - and everything below applies
to it too._

**Virtual Console only,** for the reason Generation 1 gives above. All six releases reach Bank
through Poké Transporter, and each of the three here opens a Time Capsule with each of the three
before it.

- [ ] **Crystal** (`crystal`, gen 2, standalone)
  - [ ] 1 Entity + edges  - [ ] 2 Dex list  - [ ] 3 Wild  - [ ] 4 Gifts & statics
  - [ ] 5 Trades & evolutions  - [ ] 6 Sprites  - [ ] 7 Events
  - [ ] 8 Validate + smoke test
- Crystal inherits four things from its pair without doing any work: the Tin Tower's name, the
  Bug-Catching Contest table, the renamed-places machinery and `gbc.py` itself. What is its own
  is a third sprite sheet, one more in-game trade (a Xatu for a Haunter, in the same house in
  Pewter that trades the Rapidash), a Suicune that does not roam, and the GS Ball.
- **The GS Ball is the reason Crystal matters to this dataset.** Its Virtual Console release
  turns on the event that was Japan's alone, so Celebi is catchable in Ilex Forest - the only
  game in three generations that can produce one. Gold and Silver already point at it.

### Generation 3

_Done: Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald, FireRed and LeafGreen. All five are in `DONE dex tracker.md`._

### Generation 4

_Done: all five. Diamond, Pearl and Platinum are Sinnoh; HeartGold and SoulSilver are Johto._

_What the Sinnoh games share is in `sinnoh.py` and what the Johto ones share is in `johto.py`;
what every Generation 4 cartridge shares - the wireless trading between all five, the National
Dex to 493, Pal Park out of the slot underneath - is in `ds.py`._

### Transfer-only nodes

Not playable main games, but they must exist as nodes for routes to work.

- [ ] **Pokémon Bank** (`bank`) — edges from Gen 5 and VC, both ways with Gen 6 and 7, one-way to HOME
      — two edges are already waiting for this node, and there will be six once Generations 1
      and 2 are built
- [ ] **Pokémon HOME** (`home`) — one-way in from Bank and Let's Go, both ways with Gen 8 and 9,
      per-species dex filter on deposit

_The Virtual Console releases used to be a separate job at the end of this list. They are not:
they **are** Generations 1 and 2 here, built in their place above, and the cartridges are not in
the dataset at all._

## Phase 3 — Polish

- [ ] Multiple collections: list, switch, rename, delete
- [ ] Editing a collection's settings after creation, records preserved
- [ ] Dataset version and build date shown somewhere in the UI
- [ ] Unobtainable entries handled per the decision in the spec's open questions
- [ ] Keyboard navigation through the grid and popup
- [ ] Empty and error states: no dataset, corrupt data file, cloud file locked
- [ ] Export a collection to CSV
- [ ] Collections list can be filtered on main game, name
