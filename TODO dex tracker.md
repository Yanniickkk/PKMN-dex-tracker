# Living Dex Tracker — Implementation TODO

Companion to the specification. Work top to bottom: Phase 0 and 1 build the machine,
Phase 2 feeds it one game at a time.

## How this file works

- **Every version is its own game entity.** Red and Blue are two entities, not one
  "Red/Blue" row. Same for Gold/Silver, Sword/Shield, Scarlet/Violet, and every other pair.
  Version exclusives are the whole reason this matters.
- **Phase 2 is the repeating part.** Each game has the same 7-step checklist. A game is
  "done" when all 7 are ticked and its validation run is green.
- **Games are independent.** Adding Emerald must not require touching Platinum's data.
  Anything shared belongs in Phase 0, not in a game's data file.
- Tick boxes as you go. Add notes inline under a step when something is unusual.
- **Finished items move out.** When an item is done, cut it from this file and paste it
  into `DONE dex tracker.md` under the matching section, ticked and dated. That file
  explains the exact shape. Partial work stays here until every sub-step is done.

## Phase 0 — Foundations (no game data yet)

### 0.1 Project setup
- [ ] Windows build target: installer or portable exe, verified to run on a clean machine
  - `publish/LivingDex.exe` is a single self-contained file, verified to run from an empty
    folder with nothing beside it. Still open: a Windows install without the WebView2
    Runtime, and a Windows 10 box.

## Phase 1 — First vertical slice

_Done. The slice works end to end; what it is short of is game data, which is Phase 2._

Build the whole app against two games before scaling the data out.
Target: **Platinum** as main game, **Emerald** linked.


---

## Phase 2 — Games, one at a time

### The per-game checklist

Every game below repeats these 8 steps:

1. **Entity + edges** — register the game, its metadata, and its transfer edges in both directions
2. **Dex list** — which species and forms it contains, and their numbering in this game
3. **Wild** — every encounter slot: location, sub-area, method, level range, rate, time, season, weather
4. **Gifts & statics** — starters, fossils, revives, NPC gifts, eggs, legendary statics
5. **Trades & evolutions** — in-game NPC trades, which evolution triggers are actually
   possible here, and the babies only the day care produces
6. **Sprites** — battle sprites for this generation, or the documented fallback
7. **Events** — for every entry still marked unobtainable, find out whether a distribution event
   ever handed one out, and say so in its reason
8. **Validate + smoke test** — validation green, then create a collection with this game as main game

Step 7 can only run once steps 1 to 6 are done: its input is the list of entries nothing in the
game produces, and that is not known before. It does not change what is obtainable — an event you
had to attend in 2006 is not a way to fill a dex today — it changes the answer a player gets, from
"nothing can produce this" to "nothing you can play can produce this, and here is what once did".
The place to look is the species' own *In events* section on Bulbapedia, which lists the games
each distribution was for.

Validating and smoke testing stay last, because they are the step that says the game is finished:
they should be looking at the final data, reasons included, rather than at a version of it that is
about to be edited.

Order to work in: start with Gen 3 and Gen 4 (already partly done in Phase 1),
then Gen 1–2, then forward through Gen 5 onward.

- [ ] **Pokémon Bank** (`bank`) — edges from Gen 5 and VC, both ways with Gen 6 and 7, one-way to HOME
- [ ] **Pokémon HOME** (`home`) — one-way in from Bank and Let's Go, both ways with Gen 8 and 9,
      per-species dex filter on deposit

### Virtual Console releases (optional, later)

Separate entities from the cartridges, because only these reach Bank.

- [ ] `red-vc`, `blue-vc`, `yellow-vc` — edges to Bank via Poké Transporter
- [ ] `gold-vc`, `silver-vc`, `crystal-vc` — edges to Bank via Poké Transporter

## Phase 3 — Polish

- [ ] Multiple collections: list, switch, rename, delete
- [ ] Editing a collection's settings after creation, records preserved
- [ ] Dataset version and build date shown somewhere in the UI
- [ ] Unobtainable entries handled per the decision in the spec's open questions
- [ ] Keyboard navigation through the grid and popup
- [ ] Empty and error states: no dataset, corrupt data file, cloud file locked
- [ ] Export a collection to CSV
- [ ] Filter national dex or regional dex
- [ ] Filter on game should include all games
