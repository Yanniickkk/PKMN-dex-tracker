# Living Dex Tracker — Implementation TODO

Companion to the specification. Work top to bottom: Phase 0 and 1 build the machine,
Phase 2 feeds it one game at a time.

## How this file works

- **Every version is its own game entity.** Red and Blue are two entities, not one
  "Red/Blue" row. Same for Gold/Silver, Sword/Shield, Scarlet/Violet, and every other pair.
  Version exclusives are the whole reason this matters.
- **Phase 2 is the repeating part.** Each game has the same 7-step checklist. A game is
  "done" when all 7 are ticked and its validation run is green.
- **Games are independent.** Adding Emerald must not require touching Platinum's data.
  Anything shared belongs in Phase 0, not in a game's data file.
- Tick boxes as you go. Add notes inline under a step when something is unusual.
- **Finished items move out.** When an item is done, cut it from this file and paste it
  into `DONE dex tracker.md` under the matching section, ticked and dated. That file
  explains the exact shape. Partial work stays here until every sub-step is done.

## Phase 0 — Foundations (no game data yet)

### 0.1 Project setup
- [ ] Windows build target: installer or portable exe, verified to run on a clean machine
  - `publish/LivingDex.exe` is a single self-contained file, verified to run from an empty
    folder with nothing beside it. Still open: a Windows install without the WebView2
    Runtime, and a Windows 10 box.

### 0.2 The shared forms table
- [ ] Fill `dataset/forms.json`, which has been written empty since Phase 1
  - Noticed by Yannick on 2026-09-23: turning on functional forms in a collection adds no
    entries. Not a bug in the app - `FormSelection`, `DexBuilder` and `ReferenceData` all work,
    and `FormSelection.Default` has functional forms on. There is simply nothing in the table
    for them to expand, and there never has been. Every game's step 2 has been deferring to it:
    Unown in Johto, Castform in Hoenn, Burmy's cloaks and Shellos in Sinnoh, and in Unova
    Deerling, Basculin, the drawn-apart sexes, the Therian trio, Kyurem's fusions and Keldeo.
  - PokeAPI holds this in three different places and each needs its own reading:
    - **Varieties** on the species, which are separate Pokemon entries: Landorus Therian,
      Kyurem Black and White, Keldeo Resolute, Basculin's stripes. The easy third.
    - **Forms** under a Pokemon, where the species has one variety and several appearances:
      Deerling and Sawsbuck wear a season each this way, and so do Shellos and Burmy.
    - **A flag and nothing else**: `has_gender_differences` on the species. Unfezant, Frillish
      and Jellicent have no separate entry anywhere - there are two sprites and a boolean.
  - Two things PokeAPI does not answer and a game module has to:
    - **Which `FormKind` it is.** The app's four switches are the whole point of the table, and
      the source has no equivalent field. Kyurem Black changes stats and typing; a Deerling's
      season changes nothing; the difference is the user's decision about what to chase.
    - **Which games it exists in.** `Form.Games` is what keeps Alolan Vulpix out of a Kanto
      collection. It has to be worked out from the generation the form arrived in and what each
      cartridge can actually produce - Therian Landorus is in Black 2 and White 2 only because
      the Reveal Glass is, and Kyurem's fusions want the DNA Splicers.
  - Worth doing before Generation 6, which is where regional and mega forms start arriving in
    numbers, and where an empty table stops being a gap and starts being wrong.

## Phase 1 — First vertical slice

_Done. The slice works end to end; what it is short of is game data, which is Phase 2._

Build the whole app against two games before scaling the data out.
Target: **Platinum** as main game, **Emerald** linked.


---

## Phase 2 — Games, one at a time

### The per-game checklist

Every game below repeats these 8 steps:

1. **Entity + edges** — register the game, its metadata, and its transfer edges in both directions
2. **Dex list** — which species and forms it contains, and their numbering in this game
3. **Wild** — every encounter slot: location, sub-area, method, level range, rate, time, season, weather
4. **Gifts & statics** — starters, fossils, revives, NPC gifts, eggs, legendary statics
5. **Trades & evolutions** — in-game NPC trades, which evolution triggers are actually
   possible here, and the babies only the day care produces
6. **Sprites** — battle sprites for this generation, or the documented fallback
7. **Events** — for every entry still marked unobtainable, find out whether a distribution event
   ever handed one out, and say so in its reason
8. **Validate + smoke test** — validation green, then create a collection with this game as main game

Step 7 can only run once steps 1 to 6 are done: its input is the list of entries nothing in the
game produces, and that is not known before. It does not change what is obtainable — an event you
had to attend in 2006 is not a way to fill a dex today — it changes the answer a player gets, from
"nothing can produce this" to "nothing you can play can produce this, and here is what once did".
The place to look is the species' own *In events* section on Bulbapedia, which lists the games
each distribution was for.

Validating and smoke testing stay last, because they are the step that says the game is finished:
they should be looking at the final data, reasons included, rather than at a version of it that is
about to be edited.

Order to work in: start with Gen 3 and Gen 4 (already partly done in Phase 1),
then Gen 1–2, then forward through Gen 5 onward.

### Generation 1

_Done: all three. Red, Blue and Yellow are Kanto on the 3DS._

**Virtual Console only.** Generations 1 and 2 are in this dataset as their 3DS Virtual Console
releases and not as the cartridges. A Game Boy cartridge trades with another Game Boy cartridge
and reaches nothing else, so what is caught on one can never join a living dex kept anywhere
later; the Virtual Console releases can, through Poké Transporter into Bank, and that route is
the whole reason they are here. The same decision governs Generation 2 below.

_What Kanto shares is in `kanto.py`, what Generation 1 shares is in `gb.py`, and what every
Virtual Console release shares is in `vc.py`. Twelve edges are waiting: each of the three opens
a Time Capsule with each of Gold, Silver and Crystal, and each reaches Bank._

### Generation 2

_Done: all three. Gold, Silver and Crystal are Johto on the 3DS, and everything they reach is in
`DONE dex tracker.md`._

_What Johto shares is in `johto.py`, what Generation 2 shares is in `gbc.py`, and what every
Virtual Console release shares is in `vc.py`. **Every Time Capsule is lit and every trade is
made: the six waiting edges all point at Bank.**_

### Generation 3

_Done: Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald, FireRed and LeafGreen. All five are in `DONE dex tracker.md`._

### Generation 4

_Done: all five. Diamond, Pearl and Platinum are Sinnoh; HeartGold and SoulSilver are Johto._

_What the Sinnoh games share is in `sinnoh.py` and what the Johto ones share is in `johto.py`;
what every Generation 4 cartridge shares - the wireless trading between all five, the National
Dex to 493, Pal Park out of the slot underneath - is in `ds.py`._

### Generation 5

_Done: all four. Black and White are the pair, Black 2 and White 2 the sequels, and everything
they reach is in `DONE dex tracker.md`._

_What all four share is in `unova.py`, which is also the region module: Generation 5 never left
Unova, so the hardware-and-region split `ds.py` explains has nothing on either side of it. **The
whole cartridge chain is closed: every route between two games in this dataset now has both of
its ends, and the ten edges still waiting all point at Bank.**_

### Transfer-only nodes

Not playable main games, but they must exist as nodes for routes to work.

- [ ] **Pokémon Bank** (`bank`) — edges from Gen 5 and VC, both ways with Gen 6 and 7, one-way to HOME
      — two edges are already waiting for this node, and there will be six once Generations 1
      and 2 are built
- [ ] **Pokémon HOME** (`home`) — one-way in from Bank and Let's Go, both ways with Gen 8 and 9,
      per-species dex filter on deposit

_The Virtual Console releases used to be a separate job at the end of this list. They are not:
they **are** Generations 1 and 2 here, built in their place above, and the cartridges are not in
the dataset at all._

## Phase 3 — Polish

- [ ] A hand-written table's citation should carry the day a human read the page
  - The fetched half is done: a PokeAPI citation now takes its date from the cache entry the
    answer came out of, so a rebuild from unchanged pages no longer re-dates 27,000 records
    with the build day. What is left is the 209 records whose source was read by a person and
    typed in - the in-game trades, the day care, the Bug-Catching Contest, the Karate King -
    because there is no fetch to take a date from.
  - Two ways to do it. Either each game module declares when its tables were read
    (`READ_ON = date(...)`, passed to `bulbapedia(...)`), or the build actually fetches the page
    it cites and lets the cache answer, which is honest but makes the build depend on a page it
    does not read. The first is simpler and does not pretend.
  - A third way turned up at Black 2's step 3 and is worth weighing before the other two:
    `grottoes.py` reads its page instead of citing it from memory, and its dates come out of the
    cache for free. That only works where the page is uniform enough to parse, which is not most
    of the 209 - but a table that is worth parsing never joins the queue in the first place.

- [ ] Multiple collections: list, switch, rename, delete
- [ ] Editing a collection's settings after creation, records preserved
- [ ] Dataset version and build date shown somewhere in the UI
- [ ] Unobtainable entries handled per the decision in the spec's open questions
- [ ] Keyboard navigation through the grid and popup
- [ ] Empty and error states: no dataset, corrupt data file, cloud file locked
- [ ] Export a collection to CSV
- [ ] Collections list can be filtered on main game, name
- [ ] The Pokemon Dream Radar as a source for Black 2 and White 2
  - A 3DS app rather than a game: no dex of its own, nothing caught in it, and it sends one way
    into those two and nowhere else. So it is neither a transfer edge nor an NPC with a gift,
    and it needs a shape of its own - a source that is not a game, which nothing in the dataset
    is yet. What it is worth is that some of what it sends has no other way in.
  - Not the Dream World, and not by oversight: that was a website, it closed in 2014, and a
    player starting today cannot reach any of it. The Radar is still runnable by whoever has it.
  - Worth saying in the reason a player reads: the eShop it came from shut in 2023, so it is
    ownable rather than buyable. That is a different answer from "this cannot be done".
