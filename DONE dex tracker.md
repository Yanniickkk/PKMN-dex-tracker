# Living Dex Tracker — Completed Work

Companion to `TODO dex tracker.md`. Items move here when they are finished, so the
TODO stays a list of what is still open rather than a growing archive.

## How this file works

- **Move, don't copy.** When an item is done, cut it from the TODO and paste it here
  under the matching section. The TODO shrinks, this file grows.
- **Tick the box on the way over.** `- [ ]` becomes `- [x]`.
- **Date every move.** Append ` — YYYY-MM-DD` to the item. That is the day it was
  finished, not the day it was written.
- **Keep the nesting.** A Phase 2 game moves with its 7 sub-steps intact, so the
  record shows what "done" actually covered for that game.
- **Partial work stays in the TODO.** A game with 4 of 7 steps ticked is not done;
  leave it where it is. Only whole items cross over.
- **Add a note when it is worth knowing.** Indent one line under the item for
  decisions taken, surprises found, or things deliberately left out.

Entry shape:

```
- [x] Item text, verbatim from the TODO — 2026-09-21
  - Note: what was decided, or what was skipped and why.

## Phase 0 — Foundations

### 0.1 Project setup

- [x] Pick the stack, note the choice and reason in `README.md` — 2026-09-21
  - .NET 10 + WPF hosting Blazor Hybrid (`BlazorWebView`) for the app, Python for the
    pipeline, self-contained single-file portable exe for distribution. Reasoning is in
    `README.md`.
  - The desktop project targets `net10.0-windows10.0.19041.0`, not `net10.0-windows`:
    `WebView2CompositionControl` needs the Windows SDK projections, and without them the
    app builds and then throws `FileNotFoundException: Microsoft.Windows.SDK.NET` on
    first layout.
- [x] Repository layout: `app/` and `pipeline/` separated, dataset output committed — 2026-09-21
  - `app/` holds `LivingDex.Desktop`, `LivingDex.Core` and `LivingDex.Core.Tests`;
    `pipeline/` is a standalone Python package. They share no code — the dataset format is
    the whole contract.
  - `dataset/` is tracked rather than ignored. It is empty until Phase 0.6 emits into it.
- [x] Linting, formatting, and a test runner wired up — 2026-09-21
  - .NET: `.editorconfig` + analyzers at `latest-recommended`, warnings as errors,
    `dotnet format --verify-no-changes`, xUnit via `dotnet test`.
  - Python: ruff for both lint and format, pytest. Both configured in `pipeline/pyproject.toml`.

### 0.2 Reference data schema

All eight items landed together; the entities only make sense as one set. They live in
`app/LivingDex.Core/Reference/`, with the on-disk shape in `app/LivingDex.Core/Dataset/`
and 20 round-trip tests in `app/LivingDex.Core.Tests/Reference/`.

- [x] `Game` - id, title, version, generation, region, release (`cartridge` /
      `virtual-console`), `hasNationalDex`, dex source rules - 2026-09-21
  - Dex source rules became a `DexSource` enum (`nationalDex` / `gameDex`) next to
    `hasNationalDex`, plus an optional `pairPartner` so Red knows about Blue.
- [x] `TransferEdge` - from, to, mechanism, direction, species filter rule - 2026-09-21
  - The filter is a small type hierarchy rather than flags: `all`, `nationalDexRange`
    (Time Capsule 1-251, Pal Park 1-386) and `presentInTargetDex`, which is the rule that
    makes HOME refuse a deposit into a Gen 8/9 game with no entry for the species.
- [x] `Species` - national dex number, name, types, evolution chain id - 2026-09-21
- [x] `Form` - species id, form name, form kind (`regional` / `functional` / `cosmetic` /
      `gender`), games it exists in - 2026-09-21
  - Added an optional `types` override beyond the listed fields. Every regional form has a
    different typing from its species, so without it the schema is wrong for exactly the
    case this project exists for.
- [x] `DexEntry` - game id, species or form id, that game's dex number - 2026-09-21
  - "Species or form" is a `DexTarget` carrying both, so a form entry never needs a lookup
    to find its species. The same type is reused as an acquisition method's target.
- [x] `AcquisitionMethod` - game id, target, kind (`gift` / `wild` / `evolution` / `trade`),
      method-specific fields, source citation - 2026-09-21
  - Four separate types behind one JSON `kind` discriminator, rather than one record with
    mostly-null columns. The spec table of per-method fields is not in this repo, so the
    fields were inferred from the Phase 2 checklist (step 3 for wild, step 4 for gifts and
    statics, step 5 for trades). Worth a review against the real table.
  - Every method carries a `SourceCitation`, so a disputed encounter rate can be traced
    without rerunning the pipeline.
- [x] `EvolutionRule` - from, to, trigger, conditions - 2026-09-21
  - Conditions are typed (`minimumLevel`, `heldItem`, `usedItem`, `friendship`, `timeOfDay`,
    `location`, `knownMove`, `gender`, `tradePartner`), with an `other` escape hatch holding
    prose so a game can be finished without first extending the schema.
  - Rules are global; a game being able to use one is expressed by that game having an
    `evolution` acquisition method pointing at it. That is also what makes the Phase 0.7
    "no evolution dead ends" check possible.
- [x] Decide the on-disk shape: one file per game plus shared species tables - 2026-09-21
  - `index.json`, `species.json`, `forms.json`, `evolution-rules.json`, `transfers.json`,
    and `games/<id>.json`. Documented with real serialiser output in `dataset/README.md`.
  - Written indented, camelCase, LF: the dataset is committed, so a rebuild has to produce a
    reviewable diff rather than one enormous line.
  - Ids are distinct types in code (`GameId`, `SpeciesId`, ...) and plain strings on disk.

Two things found while testing that the next phases need to know:

- An `AcquisitionMethod.Kind` property cannot be serialised alongside a `kind` discriminator;
  it is `[JsonIgnore]`d on the base *and* on each override, because System.Text.Json does not
  inherit the attribute.
- Records holding a collection compare that collection by reference, so `==` on `EvolutionRule`
  or `GameData` is not value equality. Compare the parts.

### 0.3 User data schema and storage

Model and storage in `app/LivingDex.Core/UserData/`, the WPF picker in
`app/LivingDex.Desktop/`, with 17 tests in `app/LivingDex.Core.Tests/UserData/`.

- [x] `Collection` - id, name, main game, linked games, `formsIncluded`,
      `genderDifferencesIncluded` - 2026-09-21
  - Named `DexCollection` in code. A domain type called exactly `Collection` reads badly next
    to `System.Collections`, and the analyser refuses any name ending in that word without an
    explicit exception, which `.editorconfig` now grants with a reason.
- [x] `CaptureRecord` - collection id, dex entry id, status, holding game, catch date,
      note - 2026-09-21
  - Keyed by `DexTarget`, not by a dex entry id. A dex entry id belongs to one game's
    numbering, so it would break the moment the forms setting is flipped or the main game
    changes - and 0.5 requires that toggling either setting preserves records.
  - `CaughtIn` derives the status from whether the holding game is the main game, so the two
    cannot contradict each other. `IsInconsistentFor` reports files where they already do.
  - A record survives going back to `notCaught`, so an accidental click does not throw away a
    note or a catch date.
- [x] JSON read/write with atomic writes (temp file, then rename) - 2026-09-21
  - Written through to the device before the swap, so the swap cannot promote a file whose
    contents are still in a write cache.
- [x] File location picker on first run, remembered - 2026-09-21
  - Shown from the main window's `Loaded`, not from startup. An ownerless modal gets no
    taskbar button and can sit behind another window, which on a first run is indistinguishable
    from the app hanging. Confirmed by inspection: the dialog now reports the main window as its
    owner, and the app has a taskbar button while it is up.
  - Cancelling falls back to Documents and remembers that, so the app always has somewhere to
    save and the question is asked exactly once.
- [x] Rolling timestamped backups next to the data file - 2026-09-21
  - `File.Replace` provides them in the same atomic operation that swaps the new file in: the
    old file is moved aside rather than deleted. Kept in a `.backups` directory beside the data
    file, pruned to the ten most recent.
- [x] External-change detection: warn before overwriting, reload when the file is newer - 2026-09-21
  - At the storage level: a save states the revision it believes is on disk, and is refused
    rather than applied if the file moved on. The refusal hands back what is on disk, so the
    caller can reload or merge without a second read. `ReadRevisionAsync` spots an outside edit
    while the app sits idle.
  - The visible warning and the reload prompt are Phase 1 work; there is no screen to show them
    on yet.
- [x] Test: two "machines" writing the same file, no silent data loss - 2026-09-21
  - Two stores on one file: both read the same revision, A saves, B is refused rather than
    erasing A's change, B merges what it was handed and saves. Plus a ten-way concurrent save
    where exactly one wins and the file still parses.

What protects the file, and what each part actually covers:

- The temp-file swap covers a crash mid-write.
- A lock file covers two processes on this machine, for the whole check-then-swap.
- The revision check is the only thing that covers a second machine, because no file lock
  survives a cloud sync client. It still has a window: a sync client can land a file between the
  check and the swap. The swap is atomic, so the worst case is the other machine's write being
  replaced, and that content is in the backup directory.
